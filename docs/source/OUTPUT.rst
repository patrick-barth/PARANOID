.. _output-alignments:

Alignments
----------

Directory containing deduplicated alignments in ``BAM`` format together with an index file in ``BAM.BAI`` format. BAM files are compressed binary forms of SAM files. SAM/BAM files are tab separated and show one alignment per line.
The information provided in the columns is as follows:
1. Read header
2. Bitwise FLAG
3. Name of reference sequence
4. Position of alignment (1-based)
5. MAPQ-score
6. CIGAR string
7. Name of mate read (shows * if information is not available)
8. Position of mate read (shows 0 if information is not available)
9. Length of alignment on the reference (shows 0 if information is not available)
10. Read sequence (shows * if information is not available)
11. Quality of read sequence (shows * if information is not available)


One of each is generated per sample.

Alignments are included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-cross-link-sites-peak-called:

Peak-called cross-link sites
----------------------------

.. _output-cross-link-sites-raw:

Raw cross-link sites
--------------------

Directory containing unmodified cross-link sites with all background noise retained. Cross-link sites are provided in three different formats, which are separated in one directory each; ``WIG``, ``BIGWIG`` and ``BEDGRAPH``. Each format contains identical data.
This step is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

WIG (Wiggle)
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Format to represent genome-wide coverage that consists of one line per reference chromosome, with the coverage values listed below each in a tab separated manner.
Column 1 represents the position, while column 2 shows the coverage at the current position.
For each sample, two WIG files are generated - one representing cross-link events on the forward and one on the reverse strand which can be distinguished by their filenames. The number of cross-link events on the reverse strand is shown as negative values.

.. parsed-literal::
    variableStep chrom=reference_1 span=1
    2815    1.0
    3726    1.0
    3895    1.0
    6201    1.0
    6367    1.0
    variableStep chrom=reference_2 span=1
    22  1.0
    31  1.0
    66  1.0
    80  1.0


BIGWIG
^^^^^^
An extension of the previously mentioned WIG format. While WIG uses plain text, BIGWIG uses a binary format to store the data, which reduces file size. Therefore, accessing the data requires specialized software such as IGV. 

BEDGRAPH
^^^^^^^^
A format similar to WIG or BIGWIG. BEDGRAPH files consist of four columns:
1. The chromosome name
2. The start position of the described events
3. The end position of the described events (in PARANOiD, this is the actual cross-link position)
4. Coverage of the described event (negative for reverse strand)

Visualization with IGV
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All provided file types can be easily visualized using the `Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) <https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/>`_.
To do so, first the reference sequences must first be loaded into IGV. Click on the *Genomes* tab in the top-left corner and select the source of the reference genome.

The reference track can be used to zoom in, allowing users to see cross-link sites in more detail.

.. _output-execution-metrics:

Execution metrics
-----------------

Directory containing general execution metrics of the workflow such as: 

1. container_information.txt 
    Container system used to execute the processes, along with the containers used during the workflow execution 
2. execution_information.txt 
    Contains information required to reproduce the results, such as:
        a. Command used for the execution
        b. Directory of PARANOiD
        c. Config file used
        d. Profiles used
        e. Version of Nextflow and PARANOiD
        f. Execution directory
3. parameter_information.txt 
    Contains all parameters used

Execution metrics are included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-igv-session:

IGV-session
-----------

An ``XML`` file that can bevdirectly loaded into IGV.
This can be done by clicking on the *Data* tab in the top-left corner and then on *Open Session*. A file browser will open, allowing you to navigate to the PARANOiD output directory and select the *igv-session.xml*. 
This will open a predefined IGV session that includes the reference genome, cross-link sites for all samples (forward and reverse) and the alignment files of all samples.
If the option :ref:`-\-merge_replicates <merge-replicates>` was chosen then only the merged cross-link sites will be shown.
This is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

------------------------

Peak height distribution is included in the :ref:`basic analysis <basic-analysis>`.

.. _output-reference:

Reference
---------
