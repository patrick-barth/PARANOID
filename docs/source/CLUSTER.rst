Cluster usage
=============

| PARANOiD supports the distribution of jobs to clusters via job schedulers.
| Currently supported are SGE and SLURM, but the list can potentially be expanded upon request. 
| Using job scheduling systems to distribute jobs can immensely shorten execution time.  
| If several profiles are used (e.g. using singularity together with SLURM) they are separated by a single comma (e.g. ``-profile singularity,slurm``).
